=> Cluster tables: Share same resources
=> RAC(Real Application Clusters): Db having more than 1 instance.

=> 2 types of tables: 
	1. Data tables- User creates and maintains  , 
	2. Data dictionary tables(metadata)- Created by db at the time of creating user tables, only read operations allowed.
	e.g. user_xyz, v$xyz, all_xyz, dba_xyz

=> number type takes more pace than int data type.

=> Restore: Data is as good as the old one.

=> Recovery: Trying to recover the data missing due to failure.	

=> RecycleBin: From 10g onwards. Contains all the dropped tables.
	desc recyclebin;
	select object_name, original_name, operation, droptime, dropscn from recyclebin;

=>Unused table: As good as deleted. Cannot be restored
	desc user_unused_col_tabs;
	
=>Dirty buffers: Transaction active in memory and not committed.

=> Locks
	1. Shared- Multiple instances can have lock on the same table. No write operations allowed.
	2.Exclusive- Only one instance can have the lock. Others cannot lock the table when one instance has the exclusive lock. Can do write operations.

=>Db block size: db can read 8192kb of data in a single I/O operation.

=>dual: Dummy table with single column for calcaulation purpose.
	select 8192/512 from dual;

=> Oracle has logical storage blocks made up of multiple system storage blocks.A schema cannot store data above its specified limits.
	alter user wissen quota 2m on users;
